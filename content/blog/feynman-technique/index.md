###  Meet Feynman (Richard)

![Handsome Richard](./feynman.jpg)

Known for his work on quantum mecanics, the American Nobel prize-winning physicist 
developed a method to **learn stuff**. The premise of this method is 
that in order to fundamentally understand something, you should be able to **teach it**.

#### The method is structured in four simple steps : 

1. Choose a topic/concept you want to learn about.
2. Write an explanation of the concept, but pretend you're teaching it to somebody else.
Focus on plain, simple language. Bonus point if you add examples, diagrams, ... etc.
3. Review what you just wrote, and identify the areas where you didn't know enough to explain it 
easily. **Study those areas**.
4. Re-write those shaddy sections you identified in the previous step, in simpler terms.

#### Why and how does this work

Very often, you'll read something, think *"Uh! This makes sense."*, and consider it as acquired.
The next day, you're being asked to explain this concept but you're just unable to. 

Our brain is tricking ourselves into thinking that we're experts at whatever we're able to understand. 
The truth is, if you're not able to explain it, you don't really understand it.

This technique is just a way for you to confront what you don't know, and study it. Because you're actively
engaged (writing, instead of reading), you feed your long-term memory with information that is structured in the best 
way for you to remember, because you created it.

#### Conclusion

True understanding requires an active process like teaching. The smartest kids is class aren't the ones that spend
all their time in books, but the ones that are trying to help others understand, finding analogies and re-phrasing ideas.

With the Feynman Technique, you'll be teaching yourself *anything*. You can take it to the next level by
teaching other people : do code-reviews, 
write tweet threads ([Chris Achard is **very good** at this](https://twitter.com/chrisachard/status/1175022111758442497?lang=en)), 
answer questions on StackOverFlow, start a blog or a podcast.
